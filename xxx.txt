Arrangement of Flower pot

Find the ideal placement for a flower pot in a room full of flower pots. Pots are arranged such
that all ﬂower pots in row i have height less than or equal to ones in row i+1. Flower pots in each
row are arranged in ascending order of their height.

Locate a suitable position to set the flower pot such that it does not violate the ascending order
arrangement constraint, keeping in mind the room's Length (L) and width (W). Since the room is
full, it should be noted that when adding a new flower pot, the one in the last position of the
room will be removed. Your task is to determine the correct spot for this new placement, with the
starting coordinate being (0,0) and the ending coordinate being (L-1, W-1).

Note: The higher numbered pot is to be replaced always. Example in an arrangement of 4 6
sized pots, a pot of size 5 will replace the pot of size 6 and not the pot of size 4.

Assume, L >= 1, W >= 1

Input Format:

Each input contains the following:

L W - Length & Width of room in number. Constraints - ( L >= 1), ( W >= 1) . Consider L as
Number of rows in the matrix, W as Number of columns in the matrix.

Next L line contains array A of size W, where each A[i] represents the height of the flower pots.
(1<=A[i]<=10^9)

H - Height of the flower pot in number. Constraints - (1 <= H <= 10^9)

Output Format:
I J – Where I is row number, J is column number.

Sample Test Case 1:

Input:
3 5
1 2 3 4 5
6 8 9 10 11
12 13 14 15 16
7

Output:
1 1

Explanation:

According to the information provided, the flower pots have been organized by size, starting with
the first pot being size 1 and incrementing in order for each subsequent pot. Our task is now to
position a flower pot with a size of 7. From the given room setup, we observe that the sixth pot
(sixth position) is of size 6, so the seventh pot should be placed right next to it. Therefore, the
resulting configuration is represented as 1 1

Sample Test Case 2:

Input:

3 3
1 3 4
7 8 9
11 13 15
14

Output:
2 2
