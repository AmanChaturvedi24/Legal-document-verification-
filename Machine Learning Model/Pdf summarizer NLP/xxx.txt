        case 3: System.out.print("three ");  
    }  
}  
System.out.println("done"); 

Switch takes the values 0, 1 and 2. 

Case 0 has nothing to execute. 

Execution of Case 1 is followed by 2 and 3 since there's no break statement encountered. So, one two three. 

Execution of Case 2 is followed 3 since there's no break statement encountered like before. So, two three. 

This is followed by "done". 

 

one two three two three done 
What will be the output of the program? 
int i = 1, j = -1;  
switch (i)

    case 2: j = 2;  
    default: j = 0;  
}  
System.out.println("j = " + j);  

One can not specify multiple case labels with commas, as in line 4. Hence compilation error. 

Compilation fails. 
The break statement causes an exit ___________ 

 from the innermost switch. , from the innermost loop 

What will be the output of the program? 
Given: 

10. int x = 0; 

11. int y = 10; 

12. do { 

13. y--; 

14. ++x; 

15. } while (x < 5); 

16. System.out.print(x + "," + y); 

What is the result? 

x is assigned 0 and y, 10 initially. During each iteration x is incremented by 1 and y is decremented by 1. 

The iteration stops when x equals 5. At this stage y also would have reached the value 5. Hence the output 5 5. 

5,5 
What is the output of this program? 

    class selection_statements {

                            int var1 = 5;  

                            int var2 = 6; 

                            if ((var2 = 1) == var1) 

                                System.out.print(var2);

                        }  

                    } 

Observe the if construct. var 2 is assigned 1. 1 does not equal 5, hence else block will get executed. Pre 
increment to var2 results in 2 (var2 variable now has the value 1, not 6). Hence 2 gets printed. 

2 
What is the output of this program? 

1. class Crivitch {

5. do { } while (x++ < y); 
6. System.out.println(x); 
7. } 
8. } 
 
Which statement, inserted at line 4, produces the output 12? 
The output expected is 12 (value of x). In line 5, the condition has to fail when the value of x is 11 (x gets 
incremented by 1 only after the condition checking). 

If the condition has to fail when the value of x is 11, then y (the value which is going to remain unchanged in all 
stages) has to be 11. 

int y=11;

          else 

               grade='B'; 

     } 

}

     Student s = new Student(1,"Peter",95); 

What will be the output?

Observe the below class. 

class Product{ 

   int productId; 

   String productName; 

   Product( )   { 

         productId=0; productName=” ”; 

  }  

   Product(int id, String name)   { 

         //access Account()  ---- Line 1 

        productId=id; 

        productName=name; 

   }  

} 

 Identify the valid option which is used to invoke the no argument constructor, Product(), at Line 1. 

this() invokes the current object's no argument constructor. 

this(); 
Observe the below code 

public class Product 

{ 

     int productId; 

     String productName; 

     static int count  = 0; 

  

     public Product(int pid,String name){ 

          productId = pid; 

          productName=name; 

          count++; 

     } 

     

     public static void main(String arg[]){ 

          

          Product p1=new Product(101,"Screws"); 

            
          Product p2=new Product(102,"Nuts"); 

          Product p3=new Product(103,"Nails"); 

            
     } 

} 

Drag and drop the options correctly so that the output will be 

Count is 1 

Count is 3 

System.out.println("Count is "+Product.count); 

System.out.println("Count is "+p3.count); 

Choose the correct option : 

public class Flight{  

     int flightId; 

     static int noOfSeats; 

    public static void display(){ 

          
 

     } 

} 

                       

Non static members cannot be accessed from static methods. If we want to access non static members from a 
static method it is possible by creating an object. Hence, only "noOfSeats" can be accessed, not "flightId".   

System.out.println("No of seats "+noOfSeats); 

Match the following : 

static method  → Can access static members only,  

non static method  → Can access both static and non static members 

Observe the code : 

System.out.println("No of seats "+noOfSeats);public class Employee {  

     String name; 

     static int employeeCount; 

     //Line 1 

} 

Which of the following code can be included in Line 1? 

From a static method, we can access only static members. Non static members cannot be accessed from static 
methods. 

However, from a non static method, we can access both static and non static members. 

 
public static void display(){ 
          System.out.println("Employee count "+employeeCount); 
}, 
public void display(){ 
          System.out.println("Employee count "+employeeCount); 
}, 
public void display(){ 
          System.out.println("Employee Name"+name); 
} 

For the below code, what are the valid ways to invoke display method in the main method. 

 public class Test { 

     public static void display(){ 

     } 

} 

public class Main { 

      public static void main(String a[]){ 

          //Invoke the display method 

     } 

} 

Static method can be invoked either by using the object instance or using the class name. 

Test.display();  
new Test().display(); 
Given the below code :  

  
public class AreaCalculator { 

       public double calculateArea(double radius)  {    

                 double area = PI * radius * radius;  //Instead of Math.PI 

                 return area; 

       }  

} 

Drag and drop the correct statement to use the static variable PI. 

import static java.lang.Math.PI; 

Assume class Calculator in package p1 and CalculatorService class in package p2 as shown below. 

package p1; 

public class Calculator { 

     __________ static void calculate(){ 

          //some code here 

     } 

} 

package p2; 

import p1.Calculator; 

public class CalculatorService { 

     public void display(){ 

          Calculator.calculate(); 

     } 

} 

What can be the valid access specifier for the calculate method in Calculator class so that it can be accessed 
from CalculatorService class? 

If a method defined within a class in one package has to be invoked from outside, then that method has to be 
declared public. 

public 
Given the class Book in  packages p1 and class Main in package p2.  In main to create an object of Book, which 
of the following are valid. 

Since the Book class is present within p1 package, it has to be accessed as "p1.Book", everytime, from package 
p2. 

p1.Book bookObj=new p1.Book(); 
Given the class Book and Library in two different packages : 

1. package model; 

2. public class Book { 

3.     private static void countBook( ) {  } 

4. } 

  

1. package util; 

2. public class Library  { 

3.      public static void main(String[] args) { 

4.             // insert code here 

5. } 

6. } 

What is required at line 4 in class Library to use the countBook method of Book class? 

countBook() cannot be invoked since the method is declared private. 

Library class cannot use the countBook method in Book class. 
Rearrange this code correctly. 

•  package test; 

•  import java.util.Scanner; 

•  public class Main 

•  { 

//Some code here 
} 

Given classes defined in two different files: 

  

1. package p1;

2. public class TestMain { 

3. public static void main(String[] args) { 

4. String [] names = new String[10]; 

5. // insert code here 

6. } 

7. } 

  

Identify the statement to be written in line 5 in class TestMain to call the display method of class Test. 

 p1.Test.display(names); 

What is the outcome of the code? 

  

public class Item   { 

private String description;

                                it.modifyDesc(it,"Scrumdiddlyumptious"); 

                                System.out.println(it.getDescription()); 

                                System.out.println(it2.getDescription());

                        System.out.print(y[i] + " "); 

        } 

} 

Array x is initialized with 4 values and this means reference "x" contains the starting address of the array. This 
address is copied to the array reference "y". This mean the 4 values can now be accessed with "y" as well. Then 
the reference x is assigned with a new array's starting address whose length is 2. Hence the iteration outputs 1 2

                                } 

                }  

}  

array_variable is a character array that can hold 10 characters. The for loop gets iterated for 10 times. During 
each iteration, the array index is assigned with the character "i" and printed alongside. Hence the output "iiiiiiiiii". 

i i i i i i i i i i 
Determine the output: 

class Evaluate  

{  

                public static void main(String args[])  

                {  

                                int arr[] = new int[] {0 , 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9};  

                                int n = 6;  

                                n = arr[arr[n] / 2];  

                                System.out.println(arr[n] / 2);  

                }  

} 

arr is an integer array that is initialized with 10 values.  

When n is initialized with value 6, n = arr[arr[n] / 2] evaluates to n = 3. Now, printing arr[n] / 2 will output 1.

                                                if(j == i)  

                                                { 

                                                                table[i][j] = 1; 

                                                                System.out.print(table[i][j]); 

                                                } 

                                else  

                                                { 

                                                                table[i][j] = 0;

                                                } 

                                

                                }

"table" is a 2 dimensional array with 5 rows and 5 columns. It is iterated from 0 through 3 and during each 
iteration  j==i (iteration variables) is checked. When j==i evaluates to true, the index is assigned the value "1" and 
printed. Else, assigned  "0'" and printed.  
1 0 0 
0 1 0 
0 0 1 

Given a one dimensional array arr, what is the correct way of getting the number of elements in arr 

is 

arr.length 

  

Column size is mandatory to create an array in java. State true or false 

False 

 is used to allocate memory to array variable in Java 

new 

 is used to find string length 

arr.lengthlength() 

Fill in appropriately. 

String st1 = new String("JAVA");  

String st2 = new String("JAVA"); 

String st3="JAVA" 

  objects, 

  in heap memory and 

  in string pool 

The "new" keyword allows memory for storing String to be allocated in the "heap" . Otherwise, memory is 
allocated in string pool. 

[3] objects, [2] in heap memory and [1] in string pool 

What is special about string objects as compared to objects of other derived types? 

You can concatenate two string objects using ‘+’, 

You can create string objects without or without using new operator,  

Java provides string constant pool to store the string objects 

Given: 
1.  public class MyLogger { 
2.  private StringBuilder logger = new StringBuuilder(); 
3.  public void log(String message, String user) { 
4.  logger.append(message); 
5.  logger.append(user); 
6.  } 
7.  } 
The programmer must guarantee that a single MyLogger object works properly for a multi-threaded system. 
How must this code be changed to be thread-safe? 

StringBuffer is synchronized and therefore thread-safe. StringBuilder is compatible with StringBuffer API but 
with no guarantee of synchronization. Because it’s not a thread-safe implementation, it is faster and it is 
recommended to be used only in places where there’s no need for thread safety. 

Replace StringBuilder with StringBuffer 
 is the string contained in s after following lines of code? 
                                StringBuffer s new StringBuffer(“Hello”); 

                                s.deleteCharAt(0); 

ello 

  is the valid declaration of a String. 

String s1 = null; 

Predict the output 

class String_demo 

    { 

        public static void main(String args[]) 

        { 

            char chars[] = {'a', 'b', 'c'}; 

            String s = new String(chars); 

            System.out.println(s); 

        } 

   } 

A character array is initialized with 'a', 'b' and 'c'  and the array reference is chars.  Printing this reference will 
output abc. 

321  String s1 = null;A "new" string object  is initialized with this reference and this object is referred by "s". Printing this reference will 
output abc. 

abc 
Predict the output 

class String_demo 

    { 

        public static void main(String args[]) 

        { 

            int ascii[] = { 65, 66, 67, 68}; 

            String s = new String(ascii, 1, 3); 

            System.out.println(s); 

        } 

   } 

An integer array is initialized with values 65, 66, 67 and 68. Its reference is "ascii".  A new string object is 
initialized with this reference such that the elements from index 1 through 3 alone gets copied as "characters". 
This object is referred by "s". Printing this object will output BCD which are the char-equivalents of 66, 67 and 
68.  

BCD 
+ operator can be used to concatenate two or more String objects in java. State true or false. 

True 

What will s2 contain after following lines of code?  

 String s1 = “one”; 

 String s2 = s1.concat(“two”); 

The string "two" referred by s2 is "concatenated to" the string "one" referred by s1.

The class Employee is declared in a package mainpack and the Derived classes PermanentEmployee and 
TemporaryEmployee are declared in another package subordpack. The basicPay attribute should be accessed 
only by means of a derived class object. 

How to ensure that the basicPay attribute is not accessed directly by the other classes in the subordpack? 

Employee.java 

package 
public class Employee{ 

 ;  

  int basicPay; 

} 
/*PermanentEmployee.java*/ 

 ;  

package 
public class PermanentEmployee extends Employee{ 
..... 
}   
//TemporaryEmployee.java 

package 
public class TemporaryEmployee extends Employee{ 
..... 
} 

 ;  

For a child class that is residing in a package to access a variable of its parent that is residing in a different 
package, the variable in the parent has to be declared "protected" so that it will be visible to all its children 
across packages. The "protected" basicPay attribute is not accessed directly by the other classes in the 
subordpack, in our case.

Java 5.0 onwards it is possible to have different return type for a overriding method in child class, but child’s 
return type should be sub-type of parent’s return type. The visibility of a method can only be increased as we

        a. describe ("test");b. describe ("test"); 
    } 
} 

The main method has child object(Faloodeh) referred by parent reference(Icecream). 

Then the parent reference is downcasted to child type reference and assigned to the new child reference. 

On invoking displayName() with downcasted parent and child reference, the definition in child is implemented. 

On invoking describe() with downcasted parent and child reference, the definition in child is implemented.

Since Pine object is held by Tree type reference - tree, the first condition in the if construct evalutes to true and 
hence, "Pine".

8. Dog dog2 = b1; 

9.

Which, inserted at line 9, will compile?  

  

Beagle b4 = dog2; is wrong because a child type reference can never old the parent object or parent reference. 
Beagle b3 = (Beagle) dog2; is right because a downcasted parent reference can be assigned to a 
child  reference.  

Beagle b3 = (Beagle) dog2; 

What will be the output of the following program ?

    public static void main(String args[]) 
    { 
        Trial object = (Trial)new A(); 
        object.test();

 Trial object = (Trial)new A(); produces compile time error because a parent object can never be referred by a

The main method has the two parameterized constructor call. the first statement within this definition is one 
parameterized constructor call. And the first statement within this is no parameterized constructor call.  

Hence the output : Basic arithmetic operation , 5 is the only operand supplied, Two operands supplied are 
multiplied and the resultant is 80.

final methods  

Which three statements are true? 

A protected method in class X can be overridden by any subclass of X.,  

A public static method in class X can be called by a subclass of X without explicitly referencing the class X., 

A method with the same signature as a private final method in class X can be implemented in a subclass of X.  

If you have - final class Test {} how to create a  reference for the class “Test” while inheriting it? 

 Compilation Error : we can't inherit the class which is “final”.

Which method, inserted at line 17, correctly complete the Sales class?   

Since the Sales class is not abstract, it must have the implementation for the abstract method in Employee 
class. We must not reduce the visibility of the method in the child class. Hence, protected double 
getSalesAmount() { }  

protected double getSalesAmount() { return 1230.45; }

 Compilation error. Object cannot be created for the class Square as "Square c = new Square() ". 

Will the below code will execute successfully ? 

abstract class Shape 

{ 

    final abstract int calcArea();

Since the abstract method within the abstract class is declared final, it can never be implemented in any of its 
child classes. Hence, it is an error.  

'False' 
What is the output of the given code?

         c.calcArea(); 

         c.calcVolume();

} 

Here is multilevel inheritance. The main method has object created for class Square, referred by Square type 
reference.  

The abstract methods clacArea() and calcVolume() in parent have their implementation within their children. 
Only when an implementation is not found child class, it is searched for in parent class and executed. Hence 
111, 222.

a. calcPremium () with an integer object invokes this method within the Car class that takes Number argument. 
This is because a is the Vehicle type reference and Vehicle class has  calcPremium () with a Number argument 
declared abstract. Hence, Number. 

b. calcPremium () with an integer object invokes this method within the Car class that takes Object argument. 
This is because b is the Insurance type reference and Insurance interface has  calcPremium () with an Object 
argument declared abstract. Hence, Object. 

c. calcPremium () with an integer object invokes this method within the Car class that takes Number argument. 
Hence, Number.

Exception Handling 

Observe the statements. 

Statement 1 : An abstract class cannot have non abstract methods 

Statement 2 : An abstract class should have a minimum of one abstract method in its class. 

Abstract class can have attributes and normal methods along with abstract methods.  
For a class to be abstract, it can have zero or more abstract methods. 

Statement 1 and Statement 2 are false 
If the access specifier of the display method in super class is protected, then what could be the valid specifier 
for the overriding display method in sub class? 

The subclass overridden method cannot have weaker access than super class method. Which means, when 
overriding a method, the access level cannot be more restrictive than the overridden methods access level. In 
parent class the method is protected, then in child class it can be protected or public. 

 
protected and public 

__________________ is the best example for Runtime Polymorphism. 

 Method Overriding 

If the sub class overrides the method in the parent class, the overridden method can be invoked by using either 
‘this’ or ‘super’ keyword.  State true or false. 

False 

Observe the code.

} 

public class C  implements A2  { 

} 

In the above scenario, which methods should class C override? 

In an interface when a method is just declared, by default they are public and abstract.  So when the methods in 
an interface are overridden they need to be public (access level cannot be more restrictive).  If not it leads to 
compilation error. 

public void  a11() {  }

Which is valid about java.lang.Exceptions? 

The class Exception and all its subclasses that are not also subclasses of RuntimeException are checked 
exceptions,  

The class RuntimeException and all its subclasses are unchecked exceptions 

Which of the given facts are true with respect to the blocks and order of execution of blocks in "Exceptions"? 

One or more catch blocks which are exception handlers are placed immediately after the try block,  

The finally block always executes when the try block exits or when an exception occurs,  

Catch block has an argument which can accept an argument of any exception type and it is the name of a class 
that inherits from the Throwable class 

What will happen when catch and finally block both return value? 

 method will return value returned by finally block

                                } 

            } 

"method return ->"  is followed by the function call. The try block within the function raises an exception. It is 
caught and handled. This is followed by the execution of the finally block. 

When there's a return statement in both catch and finally block, then return in finally is what is actually returned 
to the function. Hence, "method return -> finally."

The first statement within try is executed. Hence hello. 

Then, the throwit() gets invoked. Hence the first statement throwit. 

On creating RuntimeException object, it is caught and handled in the catch block. Hence caught. 

Finally block is executed whether or not an exception is raised. Hence finally. 

The statement that is independent of try will surely get executed. Hence after.
